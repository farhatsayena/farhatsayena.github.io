      A Calling from Within
    </h1>
    <div style="display:grid;">
      Hi my love!<br />
      Ek baat sata rahi hai andar hi andar aur batana chahta hu. Nahi kaha toh
      pagal ho jaunga. Anxiety ho rahi hai.<br />
      PLEASE PLEASE READ IT FULL and WITH PATIENCE!!<br />
      .<br />
      .<br />
      .<br />
      I'm trying to be the husband that you want me to be. I'm putting my 100%
      in achieving what you think is a socially presentable partner. I know
      social acceptance is a big deal for you - in our case, family and friends
      acceptance - social order. I respect that. I have no hard feelings on you
      thinking that. Par kahi na kahi aisa lagne laga hai ki logo(again, family
      and friends) ko bura na lagne k chakkar mai tu ye neglect kar deti hai ki
      mujhko bura lag raha hai.<br />
      Last time, tune daanta ki patti se khel raha tha so I made sure mai
      Bangalore mai Mazhar jiju, Asrar k saamne apna well behaved roop present
      karu and I did a good job at that. <br />
      Last week, tere yaha bhi I tried being my best self. I came to prove my
      acceptability to (y)our family. Pure mann se. Mai aaya, jutte khole, Aapa
      se haal chaal puchha - fir mai andar jaate jaate unse puchha Mazhar jiju
      kese, unhone kuch reply nahi kiya(maybe woh sune nahi honge) - mera
      confidence hila thoda - fir andar paseene ki dripping halat mai nanaji k
      paas betha - thoda unse haal puchhke bola mai aaya tha aapse milne last
      week - nanaji bole, nahi, tum kab aaye!!maane hi nahi ki mai aaya tha
      milne(bhul gaye honge) - but in that moment, mera confidence aur down.
      15-20 min waha betha betha logo se eye contact and smiles passing kiya -
      try kiya baat karne ki but 1 sentence k baad koi baat hi nahi karta -
      Abrar bhaiya toh smile bhi nahi diye(busy the Hasbiya k saath) - then jab
      tu aayi, felt like sunshine, tujhse paani manga urgent - confidence rock
      bottom tha tab. But fir mai us sofe se hila, thoda chala, Asrar bhaiya bhi
      aaye, Shahid bhi aaya - and the afternoon kicked off for me. After that I
      interracted with everybody I could - Asrar bhaiya and I toh picked up
      where we left in Bangalore. Unki wife bhi bohot achhi lagi. Dheere dheere
      all started going good. I thought I presented, behaved and talked well
      that day. <br />I know you want me to the best of the lot. Dekh Banu, in
      such events, best behaved toh mostly Huned bhaiya ya Asrar bhaiya hi
      jeetenge, best comedian Shahid(even though I feel meri comic timing is
      better than his but since your family is more adapted to Shahid jokes,
      I'll give this to him), best arrangement Taffu mama, best Showoff Altaf
      uncle, most cunning/shrewd some XYZ........ <br />But but but, in most
      rooms wherever I go, I try to be the best allrounder - Jack of all trades
      - I behave decent only, comedy bhi kar leta hu - situational mostly, mai
      kaam bhi kara deta hu - peerasgari achhi karta hu, ekdum bhi bhola/dojra
      nahi hu - I get it when someone is being mean in their words/actions, I
      don't dress THAT bad as you think I do, I'm soft spoken to elders and in
      serious talks -
      <b
        >I have been winning people's heart since ages by being me. Please let
        me be me.</b
      >
      Mai jesa hu logo ko pasand aunga. Bharosa rakh. I can't be perfect in
      everything but I'm a multi-tasker. I'm a good person. Thoda time de.
      People will like me for who I am.<br />

      Kal raat ko jaldibaazi isliye macha raha tha -
      <li>
        Humko - mujhe mummy paa - parsu nanighar se aate time police actually
        roki thi. Woh toh Paa Maa the so kuch kiya nahi but Paa told me 2 danger
        stories.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sajjad bhai Kharagoda, Piru bhai k bhai - jo namaz padate hai, unko
        Ramzan mai raat ko 10:30 kharol se Bohrawadi aa rahe the - police ne
        roke hathipole pe, gadi ki chabi le li - buri tarah pita - and kaha jao
        Bohra paidal ab. He literally came to Bohrawadi on foot and he was
        crying and sab log bahar aake unko puchh rahe the raat mai ki what
        happened. Police wale night shift mai daaru pite hi hai and given khuli
        chhut on sutai, they take pleasure in it. Sonu toh chutiya hai. Piya hua
        tha. Maar kha bhi leta. Police kisi ki sagi nahi hoti
      </li>
      <li>
        Another story, Ajju phuppi k Sibtain k saath bhi same kissa - pitai nahi
        hui - but gaadi le li and 2000 fine bhara usne next day police station
        jaake against chargesheet.
      </li>
      Isliye meri raat ko fati hui thi. Its not ki helmet k liye pakadne khade
      rehte hai police. It is CUR-FUCKING-FEW. Raat mai biwi bachho ko chhodke
      khada karwaoge roz, police wale obviously gusse mai rahenge hi. pitate hai
      woh. We are in a pandemic, love. It is serious matter.<br />
      I know logo ko bura lag sakta hai agar hum nikal jae before others but it
      was important. <br />
      .<br />
      .<br />
      .<br />
      Logo ko bura na lage uske chakkar mai PLEASE PLEASE ye mat ignore kar ki
      mujhe bhi bura lagta hai kabhi kabhi. Mera bhi saath de Banu kabhi. STAND
      BY, STAND WITH and STAND FOR me too sometimes - Kuch toh log kahenge hi,
      logo ka kaam hai kehna - I can't be perfect in front of everyone, neither
      can you - but we can be a perfect couple - we can be a perfect team. WE
      ARE A PERFECT TEAM. Family and friends and society is important but they
      won't stay up whole night painiting the best version of a HAPPY BIRTHDAY
      scene for you(after 6-7 failures), they won't interview-prep you, they
      won't pamper you when you're down due to a interview rejection or scold
      from mummy or a misunderstanding with your manager - nobody will, except
      me. I love doing it. I feel so happy making you happy. PLEASE, let me be
      me. I'll try being my best self in front of people jinka acceptance
      matters to you. I'll win people by being me. I'll take time but it will
      happen. The ice has broken. The bridge will become stronger with
      wear-and-tear. Please don't have me in a constant battle of proving myself
      in front of you, in proving I'm the best for you. I know, I AM. The world
      will know too - many probably know even right now. PLEASE, be my partner
      in crime. I BEG YOU!! Meri side pe bhi reh kabhi - tere cousin,
      Anees-Fatima, club friends k upar mere comfort(or if it is too much to ask
      for, mere peace of mind, relaxation) ko tawajjo de de kabhi please. Kamiya
      tujhme bhi hai, kamiya mujhme bhi hai, but as a couple, as a team, let
      stand up for each other, let take each other's side more often. Teri naak
      nahi katne dunga par meri marzi ko bhi maan de Banu please. I'm not
      complainning, I'm requesting, I'm begging, isse hum dono ko aage jaake
      bohot sahara milega. <br />I get severe anxiety attacks when you're not on
      the same page as I am. Please be my Banu.<br />
      .<br />
      .<br />
      .<br />
      PLEASE, BE THE WIFE I NEED, and not the one, the world wants every girl to
      be. I BEG, MY LOVE!!
